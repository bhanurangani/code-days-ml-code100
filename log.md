**Today's Progress**:Started from 0. Learned how to use data types like int, str,float. Learned how to do type casting. Used some basic string manipulation  functions.

**Thoughts:** Working on new langauage is not a challenging thing if you have your logics clear. Seems good now. Enjoying it

**Today's Progress**: Like arrays are used in other languages in C, java, etc. I came to know about lists in Python. Implemented List and Tuples, and implemented some functions on it.

**Thoughts**: Lists and Tuples are easy to implement, and fun working on.

**Today's Progress**: Today i worked on conditions like if-else,nested if else, if else if. Learned how to take input from user. And Aslo learned how to use while loop.

**Thoughts**: Thankfully, i got all my programs executed without error. I thought that error can occur in case of taking input from user.

**Today's Progress**: Today i started with learning for loop, and practiced some syntax on taking input from user using for loop.

**Thoughts**: Today, it was little tough for me, because i got stuck at a point where the expected out was not being generated. I will take the help of my sir for that.
